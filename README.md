### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title:  How do we recommand a philosopher/school to a rookie
+ This project is conducted by Jiahao Wei

+ Project summary: This data story is mainly about how do we find a suitable startpoint for getting know about philosophy with help of the data. The amounts of tokens and uncommon words of each sentences were used to determine how hard it is to read books of different schools or philosphers. And wordclouds and sentiment analysis are used to get a summary picture about the focus and emotion of different schools and philosophers, which can enable us to take personal preference into consideration.
